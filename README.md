# NumbersInterpretation
 
This program asks the user to give a valid greek phone number. 
The purpose of this program is to detect and resolve all the ambiguities of the user's input.
In order to achieve that we process the user's input, divide and analyze its series of numbers given with the appropriate filter and 
then find every possible combination that can emerge from the original input.
The program in the end filters each one of these interpretations and decides whether each case is a valid greek phone number or not.

In order to assure the proper functionality of the program Junit is used for testing purposes.
